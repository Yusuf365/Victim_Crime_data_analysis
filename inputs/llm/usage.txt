How To calculate the average number of victims per year for all categories of crimes using R, you can use the `dplyr` package to group the data by `report_year` and then summarize the average per year. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(dplyr)

# Assuming cleaned_dataset is your data frame and it has the columns 'report_year' and 'victim_count'
average_victims_per_year <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(report_year) %>%
  summarize(avg_victim_count = mean(victim_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# View the summarized data
print(average_victims_per_year)
```

This code will give you a data frame with the `report_year` and the corresponding average number of victims (`avg_victim_count`) for that year. Make sure to use `na.rm = TRUE` to handle any NA values in the `victim_count` column, if they exist.

To visualize this in a graph using `ggplot2`, you can create a line plot:

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(average_victims_per_year, aes(x = report_year, y = avg_victim_count)) +
  geom_line() +  # Add a line
  geom_point() +  # Add points
  labs(title = "Average Number of Victims per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Number of Victims") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This will produce a line graph with points showing the average number of victims per year. The x-axis will represent the years, and the y-axis will show the average number of victims for those years.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Total-Victims-by-Age 
#| tbl-cap: Overall Victims by Age-Cohort in eight-year Period
#| echo: false
# Horizontal Bar Graph for Crimes by Age Cohort
crimes_age_cohort <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(age_cohort) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(victim_count))

ggplot(crimes_age_cohort, aes(x = total_count, y = age_cohort, total_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Victim of crime by Age Cohort",
       x = "Total Count",
       y = "Age Cohort") +
  theme_minimal()
Add crime subtype

To add crime subtype to the graph, you would need to adjust the grouping and aesthetics within your ggplot function. This assumes that your data set has a column named subtype that contains the crime subtype information.

Here is an example of how you might modify your code:

{r}
#| label: fig-Total-Victims-by-Age-Subtype 
#| tbl-cap: Overall Victims by Age-Cohort and Crime Subtype in Eight-Year Period
#| echo: false

# Summarize the total count by age cohort and subtype
crimes_age_subtype <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(age_cohort, subtype) %>%
  summarise(total_count = sum(victim_count), .groups = 'drop') # Ensure grouped data is ungrouped after summarization

# Create a horizontal bar graph for Crimes by Age Cohort and Subtype
ggplot(crimes_age_subtype, aes(x = total_count, y = reorder(age_cohort, total_count), fill = subtype)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Victim of Crime by Age Cohort and Crime Subtype",
       x = "Total Count",
       y = "Age Cohort") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Adjust legend position if necessary
This code will create a horizontal bar chart where each bar represents a different age cohort, and the bars are filled with colors corresponding to different crime subtypes. The reorder function is used within aes to order the age cohorts by the total count so that the largest bar appears on top (if that's your preference).
